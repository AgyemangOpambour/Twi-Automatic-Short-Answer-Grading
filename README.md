* **ASAG Corpus:** In the "corpus" directory, you'll find essential datasets. "English" contains the benchmark dataset, "perfect_mohler_dataset_edited.csv." "Twi" hosts the "translated_data_twi.csv" and "perfect_twi_trans_test_data," fundamental for our Twi ASAG system.

ChatGPT Models: We've included scripts and resources for our ChatGPT-based ASAG models. They are designed to evaluate and grade answers in Twi.

Google Cloud Translation Models: Scripts and models to assess translation quality in the Twi ASAG corpus can be found here.

Twi ASAG Models: Our finely-tuned Twi ASAG models reside in this section.
